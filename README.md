## Description

Welcome to the future of space exploration! As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, you can view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples to assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position. 

When you load the portfolio, you will be presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer. The header will contain the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio. The navigation titles will include About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section will be highlighted. When you click on a navigation title, you will be presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title will be highlighted. 

When you load the portfolio the first time, the About Me title and section will be selected by default. The About Me section will contain a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them. The Portfolio section will contain titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository. The Contact section will contain a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message. When you move your cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, you will receive a notification that this field is required. When you enter text into the email address field, you will receive a notification if you have entered an invalid email address. 

The Resume section will contain a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies. The footer will contain text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter). 

Explore the depths of space with the help of this React portfolio and find the perfect candidate for your next space adventure!
